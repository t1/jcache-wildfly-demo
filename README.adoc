= JCache WildFly Demo `THIS IS BROKEN!`

Demonstrates the usage of JCache (JSR-107) in WildFly (24, 25, and 26)

I couldn't find how to use JCache annotations like `@CacheResult` on (more recent) versions of WildFly.
These older references didn't work/help:

* https://blog.sebastian-daschner.com/entries/caching-method-results-jcache
* https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/titles/developing/developing.html#jcache_jsr_107
* https://infinispan.org/docs/stable/titles/developing/developing.html#cdi_support
* https://schneide.blog/2019/03/26/cache-configuration-with-wildfly-infinispan-cdi-and-jcache/ (this is not about the annotations)

It's a bit tricky to use the Infinispan modules that come with WildFly while only adding those libs that are missing.
So we simply use https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine[caffeine].
Note that this is not integrated very well into the WF configuration mechanisms, i.e. you'll have to use Typesafe config (see https://github.com/ben-manes/caffeine/wiki/JCache[caffeine JCache extension]).

I don't understand why JCache is not under the JavaEE, Jakarta, or MicroProfile umbrella specs.
(Yes, I've read some of the discussions).
